# First Year Group Project:
*Disclaimer*: This was the first time all of us had worked on a group project, and the first time working with git. There are many examples of bad practices, but it was a learning experience and we have all improved massively since.

A web application for users to create and host pub quizzes.
Sure, services like Kahoot already exist. However, when the players are given 4 or so options for each question guessing becomes easy. Part of the intrigue of a pub quiz comes from its difficulty from this lack of multiple choice. You either know the answer, or you guess blindly.
The problem I found with traditional paper-based pub quizzes is that it takes a while for the host to go through and mark all the team's papers. With our application marking and answering are parallelised to streamline the experience.
